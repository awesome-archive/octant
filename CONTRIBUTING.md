# Contributing

## Communication

We prefer asynchronous to synchronous communication when ever possible. This ensures that all interested parties are able
to find relevant information even when ideas and information are being exchanged across many timezones. When ever
synchronous communication is happening, we encourage folks to make best efforts to transfer that information to an
issue if relevant or send it to the project-octant group. This could be as plain text notes or a link to a recording
or markdown document for example.

### Weekly Community Meeting
We have a weekly Octant community meeting that is held live (recordings uploaded later). We highly encourage folks
who are interested in contributing to Octant to attend these meetings. More details on the
 [Octant community page](https://octant.dev/community/).

## Tools

The Octant project uses GitHub issues and pull requests as the primary method for communicating about what work needs
to be done, what work is currently being done, who work is assigned to, and the current state of that work.
With GitHub issues we use the ZenHub tool. ZenHub gives us another layer of metadata on top of GitHub issues that
allow for visualizing work as being in various states and displaying columns for each state. We highly recommend that
folks who intend to work on Octant familiarize themselves with ZenHub and GitHub issues.

A very helpful browser extension that will create a ZenHub tab on GitHub for you.

### ZenHub Lanes

We use the different lanes in ZenHub to help organize our work. Below is some details about what each lane means.

- New issues: new issues that are not triaged yet.
- Unsorted: unsorted issues have been looked at, given labels, de-duped, and assigned to Epics.
- Backlog: these issues are sorted and are next up to work on after the Sprint Backlog. (limit 20)
- Sprint Backlog: issues here are the current items you can pull from to work on. (limit 20)
- In Progress: issues here are being actively worked on.
- Review/QA: issues here usually have a PR associated with them and are ready to be reviewed.
- Done: (unused/skipped)
- Epics: stores all of the current Epics to keep them from cluttering up the work lanes.
- Closed: all issues that have been closed.

## CHANGELOG

Authors are expected to include a changelog file with their pull requests. The changelog file
should be a new file created in the `changelogs/unreleased` folder. The file should follow the
naming convention of `pr-username` and the contents of the file should be your text for the
changelog.

    octant/changelogs/unreleased   <- folder
        000-username               <- file

## Proposals

If you wish to add a larger feature or make a major refactor to Octant we encourage folks to write up a proposal document.
Though our process is not formal, the convention is to create a PR against Octant with your proposal as markdown in the
proposals folder. Proposal reviews and feedback will happen on the the PR with the proposal.

    octant/proposals       <- folder
        YYYYMMDD-title.md  <- file

In your proposal it is good to consider and include some of the following:
* Goals
* Non-Goals
* Does this break any public APIs?
* Does this fix/solve any outstanding issues?
